		<br class="none" />
		See, many bars in the same color move synchronously and reach similar amount of donation. it implys the board members’ donations were not actually personal. They probably set amount of donation by positions. And the money would represent the intentions of the companies.

		<h2>Context:</h2>
		Japanese electric power companies had been publicly proclaiming that they refrain from donating to political parties since 1974 because of publicness of the operation.

		The causation and aftermath of Fukushima nuclear disaster were probably affected by such politics-electric industry corruption.
		<br class="none" />
